# Data Persistence Verification

## Original Issue (Japanese)
> 入力した内容がワールドを読み込みなおした場合などに，データが保持されていないため，データの永続化を実装する．

**Translation**: "Since the entered content is not preserved when the world is reloaded, implement data persistence."

## Root Cause Analysis
The original implementation stored MarkdownBook data using `DataComponents.CUSTOM_DATA` in NBT format, which was correct for persistence. However, the issue was that when players edited books through the GUI, the changes were only applied to the client-side ItemStack. The server's copy of the ItemStack remained unchanged, so when the world reloaded, the server's (unmodified) version was restored.

## Solution Implementation
Our implementation adds proper client-server synchronization:

### Before (Problem):
```kotlin
// Only modified client-side ItemStack
private fun saveAndClose() {
    markdownBook.setTitleAndContents(itemStack, titleEditBox.value, contentEditBox.value)
    onClose()
}
```

### After (Solution):
```kotlin
// Sends packet to server for proper synchronization
private fun saveAndClose() {
    val packet = UpdateMarkdownBookPayload(hand, titleEditBox.value, contentEditBox.value)
    PacketDistributor.sendToServer(packet)
    onClose()
}
```

## Implementation Components

1. **Network Packet** (`UpdateMarkdownBookPayload`)
   - Carries title, content, and hand information
   - Uses proper NeoForge StreamCodec for serialization
   - Implements CustomPacketPayload interface

2. **Packet Registration** (`ModNetworking`)
   - Registers packet with NeoForge networking system
   - Sets up client-to-server communication channel

3. **Server-Side Handler**
   - Receives packet and updates server-side ItemStack
   - Calls `broadcastChanges()` to mark inventory as dirty
   - Ensures changes are written to world save data

4. **Updated GUI Logic**
   - Tracks which hand holds the MarkdownBook
   - Sends network packet instead of local modification
   - Maintains same user experience

## Data Flow
1. Player opens MarkdownBook → Client remembers which hand
2. Player edits content → Local GUI updates
3. Player clicks Save → Network packet sent to server
4. Server receives packet → Updates ItemStack in player inventory
5. Server marks inventory dirty → Changes saved to disk
6. World reload → Server loads persisted data ✓

## Verification
- ✅ NBT data structure unchanged (maintains compatibility)
- ✅ Network communication properly implemented
- ✅ Server-side persistence ensured
- ✅ Both main hand and off-hand support
- ✅ Follows NeoForge networking best practices
- ✅ Test validates core persistence logic

This implementation fully addresses the original issue by ensuring that MarkdownBook content persists across world reloads through proper client-server synchronization.
